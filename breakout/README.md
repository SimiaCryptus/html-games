# Breakout Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Breakout game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a ball, a paddle, and a set of bricks. The player needs to break all the bricks by hitting them with the ball using the paddle.

## Features

- **Canvas-based rendering**: The game elements are drawn on a HTML canvas.
- **Collision detection**: Detects collisions between the ball and the bricks, the ball and the walls, and the ball and the paddle.
- **Responsive controls**: The paddle can be controlled using both keyboard (arrow keys) and touch events on mobile devices.
- **Score tracking**: The game tracks the number of bricks broken and displays the score.
- **Game over and win conditions**: Alerts the player when the game is over or when all bricks are broken.

## Setup

To run this game, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
