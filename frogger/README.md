# Frogger Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Frogger game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Overview

In this game, the player controls a frog character and tries to navigate it across a busy road and a river to reach the other side. The objective is to avoid getting hit by cars on the road and to hop on logs to cross the river safely.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the frog.
- Avoid colliding with the cars on the road.
- Jump on the logs to cross the river safely.
- If the frog collides with a car or falls into the water, the game resets.
- The game starts when the "Start Game" button is clicked.

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the game layout.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the game elements.
- `game.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and functionality.
- `player.png`: The image file for the frog character.
- `car.png`: The image file for the car obstacles.
- `log.png`: The image file for the log obstacles.

## Getting Started
